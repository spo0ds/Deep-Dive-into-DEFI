## DEX Aggregator: Simplifying DeFi Trading

Imagine a DEX aggregator as the equivalent of a search engine for DeFi trading. Just as you would use platforms like "Expedia" or "Google Flights" to find the best flight deals instead of visiting each airline's website individually, a DEX aggregator helps you discover the optimal prices for your trades across different decentralized exchanges.

A DEX aggregator is a service that combines liquidity from various decentralized exchanges and market makers, streamlining the process of finding the most favorable prices for your trades.

The DeFi landscape is rich but fragmented, with liquidity spread across numerous sources. To ensure you get the best deal, you'd have to visit multiple trading venues. Some exchanges offer attractive rates but come with high slippage, while others provide lower slippage at the cost of less favorable rates. Aggregators solve this complexity by presenting all this data and liquidity in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to access the best prices.

**Two Types of Aggregators**

- Off-chain Aggregator (e.g., 1inch, Paraswap):

  - Pros: Can bridge multiple chains, offers flexibility.
  - Cons: Operator might front-run users.

- On-chain Aggregator (e.g., Swapswap):
  - Pros: Enables atomic routing and arbitrage.
  - Cons: Might not efficiently cover more than four exchanges.

## 1inch: Optimizing DeFi Trades

1inch serves as both a non-custodial decentralized exchange and a DEX aggregator. This platform connects various DEXs into a unified interface, allowing users to optimize their decentralized cryptocurrency trades without manually checking rates across each DEX. Smart contracts within 1inch source liquidity from multiple DEXs like Balancer, Kyber Network, Uniswap, and Mooniswap.

1inch supports over 250 coins and tokens, streamlining trading activities.

In simple terms, 1inch employs APIs to identify the best route for decentralized token swaps. This could involve multiple exchanges to achieve the most optimal trade execution. Consequently, users receive the best rates, with minimized slippage and reduced transaction cancellations.

Operating as a decentralized exchange, 1inch eliminates the need for an account or identity information. Users connect supported Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger) to start using the platform instantly. As a non-custodial service, 1inch never gains full control over user assets; it executes trades with the user's permission.

## Smart Contract Walkthrough

**Aggregation Protocol V5**

The AggregationRouterV5 contract serves as a main aggregation router that incorporates various router contracts and mixins to provide functionalities for swaps and limit orders protocol.

```solidity
/// @notice Main contract incorporates a number of routers to perform swaps and limit orders protocol to fill limit orders
contract AggregationRouterV5 is EIP712("1inch Aggregation Router", "5"), Ownable,
    ClipperRouter, GenericRouter, UnoswapRouter, UnoswapV3Router, OrderMixin, OrderRFQMixin
{}
```

The AggregationRouterV5 contract integrates advanced features, including:

    EIP712: Used for handling structured data and signing messages. It uniquely identifies the contract's domain using "1inch Aggregation Router" and version "5."
    Ownable: Empowers the contract owner to control specific actions.
    ClipperRouter, GenericRouter, UnoswapRouter, UnoswapV3Router: These components facilitate trade routing and interactions with different protocols and exchanges, optimizing execution.
    OrderMixin, OrderRFQMixin: These handle various aspects of limit orders and RFQ (Request for Quote) orders, ensuring efficient execution and validation.
